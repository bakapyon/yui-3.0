### Project Yui
Yui is a bot in English, Spanish and Portuguese created and maintained up-to-date by KillovSky to WhatsApp Group "Horizon", she have more that 200 commands and frequent update of fixes and new things.

### Another Language
Si quieres un tutorial en español, abre lo [Tutorial Español](https://github.com/KillovSky/yui/blob/main/.readme/es/README.md), para um português use o [Tutorial PT-BR](https://github.com/KillovSky/yui/blob/main/README.md).
To make your bot completely in another language, open [language](https://github.com/KillovSky/yui/blob/main/lib/config/config.json#2) and change from "pt" for "en" which is English or "es" for Spanish, there are no languages other than these - not yet.

### Only Phone
On cellphone it's impossible you can use, incluse on Termux, but you can use the site [Goorm](https://ide.goorm.io) or the app [Google Cloud-Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell) to make a Yui, but will disconnect frequent, is much better a use from a computer.

### Personal Note
This software uses the [MIT](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) license, it's proibited the removal of credits, and i'm expending a LOT of time without gain nothing to make this better, please, do not remove the credits of my bot.
If you see someone stealing or who has stolen, show the truth, tell them it is plagiarism, is the only desire i have.

### Requiriments

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) - LTS recommended.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com) - For the Unix-Tools - Careful.
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) - For gif command.
- [Libwebp](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/download) - Help the FFmpeg and other things.
- If needs help to install FFmpeg, view the [WikiHow](https://www.wikihow.com/Install-FFmpeg-on-Windows), to install Libwebp follow the same steps, but changing the folder name to libwebp, doing the same in the "setx" command.

To install all programs above at Linux, use that command:

```bash
> sudo apt install nodejs git ffmpeg libwebp -y
```

If have some errors at Node, try using the [Node Source](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions), remember, LTS version.
